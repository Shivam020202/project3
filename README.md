Google homepage 

This project has been made by me while learning and experimenting css and html stuffs by my own 

There are few inspirations from online tutorials and websites 

Such as the gradient animation , is something i learnt to do from a online tutorial and the cards feature has also been practiced through some website ,

It was a nice experience learning and implementing all of those stuff by myself .

As of now there are just design and many experimented stuff , i'm not sure if it would last till the end , but what i aim to do further in this website is 
work over the functionality of search bar of google to actually perform searches like google does .

I lack the required javascript knowledege as of now to do that . 

i hope i complete this project sooner :) 

thanks for viewing 

have happy time exploring my profile and repositories :)
